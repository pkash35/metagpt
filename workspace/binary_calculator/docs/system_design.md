## Implementation approach

We will use the Tkinter library to create the user interface for the binary calculator. This library is a standard GUI toolkit for python and it is open-source. We will create a Calculator class to handle the logic of the binary calculations. The class will have methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We will also use the built-in python functions bin(), int() and str() for binary and integer conversions. The user inputs will be handled by the Tkinter Entry widget and the results will be displayed in a Label widget. The clear function will be implemented using a Button widget that resets the Entry widget.

## Python package name

binary_calculator

## File list

- main.py
- calculator.py

## Data structures and interface definitions

        class Calculator{
            +str binary1
            +str binary2
            +__init__(binary1: str, binary2: str)
            +add(): str
            +subtract(): str
            +multiply(): str
            +divide(): str
        }
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant C as Calculator
        M->>C: __init__(binary1, binary2)
        Note over M,C: User inputs binary numbers
        M->>C: add()
        Note over M,C: Result is displayed
        M->>C: subtract()
        Note over M,C: Result is displayed
        M->>C: multiply()
        Note over M,C: Result is displayed
        M->>C: divide()
        Note over M,C: Result is displayed
        M->>M: clear inputs and results
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
