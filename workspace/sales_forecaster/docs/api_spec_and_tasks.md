## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Main entry of the application. It creates and runs the App.']
- ['data_generator.py', 'Contains the DataGenerator class. It uses Faker to generate mock sales data.']
- ['forecaster.py', 'Contains the Forecaster class. It uses Prophet to forecast sales data.']
- ['app.py', 'Contains the App class. It uses DataGenerator and Forecaster to generate and forecast data, respectively.']
- ['templates/index.html', 'The user interface of the application. It displays the forecasted data.']

## Task list

- data_generator.py
- forecaster.py
- app.py
- main.py
- templates/index.html

## Shared Knowledge


        'data_generator.py' contains the DataGenerator class which uses Faker to generate mock sales data.
        'forecaster.py' contains the Forecaster class which uses Prophet to forecast sales data.
        'app.py' contains the App class which uses DataGenerator and Forecaster to generate and forecast data, respectively.
        'main.py' is the main entry of the application. It creates and runs the App.
        'templates/index.html' is the user interface of the application. It displays the forecasted data.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
