## Implementation approach

We will use pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computation, faker to generate mock data, matplotlib for data visualization, and Prophet (from Facebook) for time series forecasting. The difficult point is to generate realistic mock sales data and to forecast it accurately. We will use faker to generate mock sales data and Prophet for forecasting. The user interface will be built using Flask, a lightweight web framework.

## Python package name

sales_forecaster

## File list

- main.py
- data_generator.py
- forecaster.py
- app.py
- templates/index.html

## Data structures and interface definitions


    classDiagram
        class DataGenerator{
            +faker.Faker faker
            +int years
            +generate(): pandas.DataFrame
        }
        class Forecaster{
            +prophet.Prophet model
            +forecast(data: pandas.DataFrame): pandas.DataFrame
        }
        class App{
            +Flask app
            +DataGenerator data_generator
            +Forecaster forecaster
            +run()
        }
        DataGenerator "1" -- "1" App: has
        Forecaster "1" -- "1" App: has
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant A as App
        participant D as DataGenerator
        participant F as Forecaster
        M->>A: create app
        A->>D: create data generator
        A->>F: create forecaster
        M->>A: run app
        A->>D: generate data
        D-->>A: return data
        A->>F: forecast data
        F-->>A: return forecast
        A->>M: return forecast
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
