## UI Design draft

The game will be text-based, with the snake represented by a series of characters. The score will be displayed at the top of the screen. The game will be played in a bordered area in the console. The snake will move in real time, and the user will control its direction using the keyboard.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific controls for the game are not specified in the requirements. For simplicity, we will use the arrow keys for movement.
