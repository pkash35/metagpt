## Implementation approach

We will use Python's built-in libraries such as curses for the CLI interface and game rendering, and threading for handling simultaneous user input and game updates. The game will be object-oriented, with separate classes for the Game, Snake, and Food. The Game class will control the game loop and handle events, while the Snake and Food classes will represent their respective entities. The game will be single-threaded, with the game loop running in the main thread and user input being handled in a separate thread.

        class Game{
            +start_game()
            +end_game()
            +restart_game()
            +update_score()
            +int score
        }
        class Snake{
            +move()
            +grow()
            +check_collision()
            +list body
            +str direction
        }
        class Food{
            +generate()
            +tuple position
        }
        Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
        Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls
    

## Program call flow

        participant M as Main
        participant G as Game
        participant S as Snake
        participant F as Food
        M->>G: start_game()
        loop game loop
            G->>S: move()
            G->>S: check_collision()
            alt collision with border or self
                G->>G: end_game()
            else collision with food
                G->>S: grow()
                G->>F: generate()
                G->>G: update_score()
            end
        end
        G->>M: end_game()
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
