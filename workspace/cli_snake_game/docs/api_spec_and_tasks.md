## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Main entry of the program, should initialize and start the game']
- ['game.py', 'Game class with methods: start_game, end_game, restart_game, update_score']
- ['snake.py', 'Snake class with methods: move, grow, check_collision']
- ['food.py', 'Food class with method: generate']

## Task list

- main.py
- game.py
- snake.py
- food.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'main.py' is the main entry of the program. It initializes and starts the game.
        'game.py' contains the Game class which controls the game loop and handles events.
        'snake.py' contains the Snake class which represents the snake in the game.
        'food.py' contains the Food class which represents the food in the game.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
